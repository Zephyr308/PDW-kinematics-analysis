# Passive Dynamic Walker (PDW) 2D Kinematics Analysis

This MATLAB-based project performs kinematic and energy analysis on a digitized passive dynamic walker (PDW) trial. It was developed for the **Animal Locomotion and Bio-inspired Robotics** unit at **Imperial College London**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To analyze the most consistent passive walking trial captured via 2D video, following digitization in **DLTdv8**. This includes:

- Computing joint angles and gait patterns
- Estimating center of mass (CoM) trajectories
- Analyzing potential and kinetic energy over time
- Comparing experimental results with simulated PDW behavior

---

## ðŸ§ª Methods

- Marker trajectories were digitized using **DLTdv8** from side-view PDW video.
- Time-series kinematic data were loaded in MATLAB for further processing.
- Absolute interleg angles, stance leg angles, CoM displacement, and energy profiles were computed.
- Non-dimensional time was used for normalized visualization across steps.
