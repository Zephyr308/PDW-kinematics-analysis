# 🧠 Background

This repository focuses on the kinematic analysis of a **Passive Dynamic Walker (PDW)**—a minimalist bipedal system that can walk down a slope powered solely by gravity, with no actuation or control inputs.

## 🧩 Motivation

Understanding the mechanics of legged locomotion is essential in fields like:

- Biomechanics
- Bio-inspired robotics
- Gait analysis
- Energy-efficient robotic design

By carefully analyzing motion data, we can reveal performance characteristics, instabilities, and opportunities for design optimization.

## ⚙️ Theoretical Basis: Inverted Pendulum Model

The PDW system is often modeled as a **compass-gait biped**, inspired by the **inverted pendulum model**. Key characteristics:

- Each leg acts like a pendulum, pivoting from the hip
- Forward motion is generated by gravity on a gentle incline
- Gait stability arises from specific combinations of **stance angle** and **inter-leg angle**

The walker exchanges **potential energy (PE)** and **kinetic energy (KE)** passively during walking, offering insights into natural gait efficiency without active control.

## 🧪 Data Collection & Processing

The motion of the PDW was captured using a **high-frame-rate side-view camera**. Key points on the walker (e.g., hip joint, leg tip) were digitized frame-by-frame using [DLTdv8](http://biomech.web.unc.edu/dltdv/), a MATLAB-based annotation tool.

Data includes:

- 2D coordinates over time
- Calibration based on known physical distances
- Marker trajectories processed to extract:
  - Leg angles
  - Center of mass (CoM) displacement
  - Energy dynamics (PE and KE)

## 🛠 Physical Setup

The physical PDW system includes:

- Two rigid legs connected by a central rod or pivot
- A slightly inclined ramp (~4°)
- Passive joints at hips and feet
- Optional visual markers for motion tracking

## 📈 Analytical Outputs

The analysis pipeline produces:

- Time-series plots of leg angles
- State-space plots (inter-leg vs. stance angle)
- CoM trajectories (horizontal & vertical)
- Energy plots (PE and KE over time)
- Visual indicators of gait symmetry and stability

These visualizations help assess whether the walker is demonstrating **stable walking** or **limping behavior**, and how performance changes across repeated trials.

## 🔍 Applications

This approach has broader relevance in:

- Robotic gait optimization
- Prosthetics and orthotics
- Comparative studies in animal and human locomotion
- Educational tools for dynamics and kinematics
